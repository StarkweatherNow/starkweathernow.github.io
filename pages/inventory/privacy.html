        <h2>Camera Access</h2>
        <p>Our app requests access to your device's camera solely for the purpose of scanning barcodes. We have built a custom user interface that utilizes Google's ML Kit for barcode recognition. The camera feed is never stored, transmitted, or processed outside of your device. All scanning operations happen locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>Storage Access</h2>
        <p>Our app may request storage permissions to allow you to export inventory reports to your device. We do not access any files outside of what you explicitly choose to save from our app.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All inventory data, including scanned barcodes, item descriptions, and any custom fields you create, are stored locally on your device. This data is not backed up to any cloud service by our app, nor is it transmitted to us or any third parties.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our app uses Google's ML Kit for barcode scanning functionality. This component operates entirely on your device and does not transmit scan data to Google or any other third party.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
